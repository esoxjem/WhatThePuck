# WhatThePuck

A minimal espresso shot tracker iOS app for the obsessive home barista.

Track your shots. Dial in your beans. Chase the god shot.

## What it does

- **Log every shot** — dose, yield, time, grind setting, and notes
- **Track your beans** — roaster, roast level, and days off roast
- **Built-in timer** — time your shots without switching apps
- **Automatic ratios** — see your extraction ratio at a glance
- **Rate and favorite** — remember what worked

No cloud. No accounts. Just you and your espresso.
